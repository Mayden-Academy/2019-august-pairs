The aim of the game is to find all 8 matching geckos.
To play the game, click once to turn over an initial card and click again to try to find a matching pair.
If you find a match, both cards will remain turned over and no longer be clickable.
If you donâ€™t find a match, the cards will be hidden again and you can try again.
The game is finished when all the pairs have been found.
