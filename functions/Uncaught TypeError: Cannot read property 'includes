Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined - WHY: cardsTurn dosent exist
game.clicks is NaN - clicks property doesent exist in game object
Matching Cards don't get matched: checkMatch not added as a script in index.html
game.cardsTurn - not emptied at end of a turn - code missing from check match for non match
game.matchedCards - dosent get card id's added to it
Added reset for non matching cards
Second card of non matching dosent show, added a set timeout
Add conditional to card event listener stopping matched cards from being clicked
